# rouille

Aren't you *le tired* from writing Rust programs in English? Do you like saying
"merde" a lot? Would you like to try something different, in an exotic
language?

**rouille** (French for *Rust*) is here to save the day, and allows one to
write Rust programs in French. See the [examples](./examples/src/main.rs) for
more details about what can be done with it.

## contributions

First of all, *merci beaucoup* for considering participating to this joke, the
French government will thank you later! Feel free to throw in a few identifiers
here and there, and open a pull-request against the `principale` (French for
`main`) branch.

## but why would you do zat

- horsin around
- making a bit of fun of programming languages using French keywords
- winking at [Marcel](https://github.com/brouberol/marcel)
- playing with raw proc macros
- c'est chic
